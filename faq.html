<p>Maud is named after a <a href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Maud_Pie">character</a> from <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>.
It does not refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maud_and_other_poems">poem</a> by Alfred Tennyson, though other people have brought that up in the past.</p>
<p>Here are some reasons why I chose this name:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Maud&quot; shares three letters with &quot;markup&quot;;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The library is efficient and austere, like the character;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google used to maintain a site called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/22/html5rocks-google/">&quot;HTML5 Rocks&quot;</a>, and Maud (the character) is a geologist.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Wouldn't it be more efficient if it wrote to a handle directly?</h3>
<p>Good question! In fact, Maud did work this way in the past.</p>
<p>But it's hard to support buffer reuse in an ergonomic way.
The approaches I tried either involved too much boilerplate, or caused mysterious lifetime issues, or both.
Moreover, Maud's allocation pattern—with small, short-lived buffers—follow the fast path in modern allocators.
These reasons are why I changed <code>html!</code> to return a <code>String</code> in version 0.11.</p>
<p>That said, Rust has changed a lot since then, and some of those old assumptions might no longer hold today.
So this decision could be revisited prior to the 1.0 release.</p>

Can't it use <code>macro_rules!</code> instead?</h3>
<p>This is certainly possible, and indeed the <a href="https://github.com/Stebalien/horrorshow-rs">Horrorshow</a> library works this way.</p>
<p>I use procedural macros because they are more flexible.
There are some syntax constructs in Maud that are hard to parse with <code>macro_rules!</code>; better diagnostics are a bonus as well.</p>

<p>I originally planned to cut a 1.0 after implementing stable support.
But now that's happened, I've realized that there are a couple design questions that I'd like to resolve before marking that milestone.
Expect a blog post on this topic Very Soon®.</p>
<h3><a href="#why-doesnt-maud-implement-context-aware-escaping" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="why-doesnt-maud-implement-context-aware-escaping"></a>Why doesn't Maud implement <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2009/03/reducing-xss-by-way-of-automatic.html">context-aware escaping</a>?</h3>
<p>I agree that context-aware escaping is very important, especially for the kind of small-scale development that Maud is used for.
But it's a complex feature, with security implications, so I want to take the time to get it right.</p>
