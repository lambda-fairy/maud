# The Maud Ecosystem

Maud is small by design, but there are a few tools that round out the authoring
experience. This page highlights community projects that pair well with Maud
templates.

## Template helpers

### maud-extensions

[maud-extensions](https://github.com/eboody/maud-extensions) provides proc
macros for inline CSS, inline JavaScript, and font helpers. It is especially
useful when you keep small, component-scoped styles or scripts close to your
Maud views.

## Formatting

### maudfmt

[maudfmt](https://github.com/Jeosas/maudfmt) is a formatter for Maud templates.
It can help keep large template files consistent and readable across a team.
