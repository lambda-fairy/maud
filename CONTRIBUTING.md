# Contributing to Maud

Great to see that you want to help out! Here are some tips for getting started:

* Please leave a comment on the issue you're working on, so that other people don't duplicate work.

* Most contributions should include [tests] and a [changelog entry].

    * If you're adding or updating a web framework integration, you might need to update the [doctest crate].

* Want to work on documentation? See the [docs readme] for advice on that.

Have fun! ☺️
