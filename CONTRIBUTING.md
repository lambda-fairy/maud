# Contributing to Maud

Great to see that you want to help out! Here are some tips for getting started:

* If you're just starting out, I suggest tackling some [easy issues] first.

* Please leave a comment on the issue you're working on, so that other people don't duplicate work.

* Most contributions should include tests – see the [existing test code] for how to write these.

* Documentation for Rust compiler APIs can be found on [Manishearth's site].

Have fun! ☺️
